# ## Approach 1: Sample increase by bootstrapping 1,000 times 

# ***Packages needed:*** boostrap,sampler

# ***What we did:*** We renamed our dataset as **x** and included in a for-loop code, that allowed the sampling of the dataset followed by its bootstrapping 1,000 times. 
# This dataset was then bootstrapped 1,000 times using the function *bootstrap(x,1000,theta)*. The final result was a dataset made of 50,000 points randomly selected based on the original distribution.
# ***What we used as a starting dataset:*** *sht*
# ***What we got***: A final dataset called: *"flux1_df"* saved as a .csv file that we used for downstream operations

# Rename the dataset for clarity and convenience
x <- flux

# Define a function for bootstrapping and sampling
theta <- function(x){sample(flux,50,rep=TRUE)}

# Bootstrap the dataset 1,000 times
results_shtv1 <- bootstrap(x,1000,theta)

###### Command lines to obtain the flux1_df.csv file and description of the csv file columns ######  
# For constructing the .csv file we select the column called "thetastar" writing ***results_shtv1$thetastar*** 
# since in that column we find the fluxes created after the bootstrapping of the function created, 
# that is,the sampled flux data. We also used the functions **unlist()** and **as.data.frame()** to aid 
# the organization of the file. 
# The *.csv file created is composed of two columns:
# the first one corresponds to the sample number (1;2;3....; 50,000)
# the column under the heading "flux1_matrix" represents all the fluxes calculated. 
# With this file we can generate plots and calculate the descriptive statistics of the population (mean, standard deviation, confidence interval). 

# Construct a CSV file containing bootstrapped flux data
write.csv(results_shtv1$thetastar, "flux1.csv")

write.csv(flux1_df,"flux1_df.csv") 




# ## Approach 2: Jack-knife resampling and bootstrap of the dataset

# ***Packages needed:*** boostrap,sampler

# ***What we did:*** Using a for-loop code, similar to the one used in "Approach 1", and thanks to the function *rsamp(x, as.data.frame(flux2), n=8, replace=TRUE)* 
# we created a new dataset randomly removing 2 samples from the original file, and bootstrapping it 1,000 times, through the code *bootstrap(x,1000,theta)*. 
# The final result was a dataset, called **flux 2** made of 8,000 points randomly selected based on the original distribution of the dataset. 

# ***What we used as a starting dataset:*** *sht2*, this is always the file "shtv3.csv" but we renamed it for an easy differentiation from the first file we used. 


# ***What we got***: A final dataset called: *"flux2_df"* saved as a .csv file that we used for downstream operations

options(digits = 15) #With options(digits = 10, we changed the number of maximum digits to 10

## Approach 3: Creation of a balanced dataset from an artificial one applying SMOTE

#***Packages needed***:UBL, DMwR2,bootstrap, sampler

# ***What we did:***  First we ran the for-loop function using our original dataset ("sht") and setting the temperature as a majority class. 
# The **SmoteClassif()** function takes in the first two arguments a formula (used to know which is the target variable) and the imbalanced data. 
# The parameter "C.per" of the function controls the way the under- and over-sampling takes place. 
# In this case, temperature was the majority class and we used a balanced sampling. The output obtained was named "results_shtv1", and saved as "smote_df.csv". 
# We then obtained a new dataset, running the function rnorm (), and setting 50 as a sample size, and the mean and standard deviation of the "smote_df.csv" dataset. 
# This balanced dataset was named "shtv5" and used to run again the SmoteClassif() function using as majority class the type of value (wheter estimated, E, or reported, R), 
# and defining an over-sampling of the reported values (R=6) and that the estimated class (E=1) remained unchanged. 
# The final dataset obtained was named "results_smote" and saved as  "smotev2_df.csv"

# ***What we used as a starting dataset:*** *sht*

# ***What we got***: A final dataset named *"smotev2_df"* saved as a .csv file that we used for downstram operations
